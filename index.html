                Hi! My name is Siena and I am a software engineer. 
                I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2021
                with a double major in Economics and Applied and Computational
                Mathematics and Statistics. After college I jumped right into 
                the tech world working as a CRE appraiser at Bowery Valuation 
                where I focused on using data to accurately provide pricing 
                valuations for a variety of commercial real estate properties
                throughout the US. While I enjoyed my time with Bowery Valuation, 
                I knew that my long term career goals were not as an appraiser. 
            </p>

                From there I began my time with Rokt, a marketing technology company
                focused on ecommerce. I quickly dove into a more client facing role 
                as a customer success coordinator while also remaining focused on 
                data analysis. At Rokt my interest in the code behind the product grew
