# <Homework-1>

## Description

This project serves as a start to my personal project portfolio using HTML and CSS to build and customize the site. I've added a short About Me section and as my skills and projects grow I will be able to update the Projects section. Additionally, there are a variety of ways to contact me included in the footer.

## Usage

The main use for this project is as a starting point to designing and building a personal portfolio site that can be used for engineering interviews.


## Credits

I used Josh Comeau's CSS reset that can be found on his [online blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/).
